* Suddenly, Attention

So, it seems like my blog is getting some attention. Recently, I was even featured on the front page of [[https://news.ycombinator.com/][Hacker News]]:

Obviously, I am delighted and flattered by the number of people reading and discussing my blog. But since [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D6p-lDYPR2P8][we're living in a material world, and I am a material guy]], I kept on wondering "is there any way to monetize this in an ethical way?". Obviously, advertisements are out of the question, but are there other ways?

** VG Wort
The VG Wort, or [[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verwertungsgesellschaft_Wort][Verwertungsgesellschaft Wort]] is a German association tasked with collecting and distributing profits made secondary exploitation rights of original textual contents. Essentially, it tries to reimburse authors and journalists for the money they "lose" by texts that are copied or digitally reproduced and thus "free of charge". The money received by the VG Wort stems mostly from so-ca

* A Step-by-Step Guide for registering your Blog at VG Wort
 In what follows, I recount the steps I needed to take to register my first blog post in VG Wort. Note that all of these steps are exclusively available to *German citizens*, which is unfortunate: An internanationall available solution like the one provided by VG Wort for "making money on the internet without resorting to ads" could have beneficial consequences for everyone. But I digress...

** Registering an account
New authors nedd to first register an account, this can be done [[https://tom.vgwort.de/portal/login][here.]] I already had my account set up for my [[https://scholar.google.de/citations?user%3DtOqnGjgAAAAJ&hl%3Dde][scientific papers]].

** Registering a blog post
The first informational page on how to register a blog post is given [[https://www.vgwort.de/verguetungen/auszahlungen/texte-im-internet.html][here]]. It states the following preliminaries have to be met:
- The blog post has to contain at least 1800 characters (including whitespaces)
- There my be no copy-restriction on the resulting file (DRM)
- The text was read by a certain number of people, counted by a VG Wort tracking pixel, or "Zählmarke"

* Footnotes

[fn:1] I love the German language. It seems like no word can be considered official enough for law texts unless it has at least 5 syllables.
