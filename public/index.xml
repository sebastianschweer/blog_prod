      <description>Hello world!
I am a Data Scientist. This field is notoriously difficult to describe, but I like this definition. My job requires me to spend a lot of time each day writing code in varying languages, mostly R but also Python and SAS. This inevitably leads me to spend a lot of time thinking about both code as well as the process of programming itself. Recently, I stumbled upon1 a incredibly concise diagram:</description>

Where all you need is a decent browser, a working internet connection and you’re good to go?
Obviously, that is the case.</description>
